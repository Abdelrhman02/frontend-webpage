    <p class="p2"> You’re here because you’re ready to become a freelance web developer.

        Maybe sitting at your desk job — imagining all the creative ways of saying “I’ve had it! I quit!”

        You’ve put in hours of your time, done all the hard work — you’ve learned to code!

        Time to reap some of the rewards of all your hard work.

        It’s time to take action.

        Freelancing will change your life.
        Here are 4 major benefits when working freelance:

        A better work-life balance: You can have breakfast with your partner again!
        Being your own boss: Being a freelance Web Developer means you can work all morning (or all night for that
        matter)…
        Freedom to choose your working hours / clients / rate of pay: Say a polite ‘no thank you’ to that miserable
        client and a ‘no thank you’ to his criminally low budget too.
        The chance to work on more interesting projects: No more monotony, each month bringing a variety of work,
        clients and opportunities.
        You have the skills:
        You’ve already trained in Ruby On Rails.

        Learned HTML.

        You’re a dab hand at JavaScript.

        It’s the perfect time to join the freelance movement….

        ….become your own boss.

        If you haven’t learned to code yet, then that should be your first order of business!
